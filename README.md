<h3><b>Running the Bot</b></h3>

<b>Make a bot application with Discord:</b> You can do that [here.](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me)

<b>Download the bot:</b> Run `git clone https://github.com/OGNova/Novuh-Mod-Bot.git`

<b>Install the dependencies:</b> In the folder you ran the git command, run the following commands. `npm install`, `npm install discord.js`, `npm install fs`, and `npm install chalk`.

<b>Enter your bot's token:</b> Find the directory the bot installed to, and in settings.json and level.js, replace "Your bot's token here" with your bots token.

> <b>KEEP THIS TOKEN SECRET, BAD THINGS CAN HAPPEN IF YOU SHARE IT.</b>

<b>Run the bot:</b> Do `cd Novuh-Mod-Bot` and do `node app.js` and `node level.js` if you want to trigger the level system.

<b>Disclaimer:</b>

Some of the commands are broken. I am aware of this. If you happen to find a command that does not work, feel free to join my [support server](https://discord.gg/qtpgmFe) and let me know.
